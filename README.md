# Data-Spider-Genesis

Python Plotly Dash Web Application that aims to visualize any structured dataset and analyze most semi-structured datasets provided 
by the user at run time.

I also plan for the app to deal with unstructured data, but that will happen in the future as I progressively develop the app.

I plan for the App to stay open-source until I see the opportunity and need to monitize it.

So I give permission to use some of the code in the app for referral purposes, but all copyright of this application belongs to me.
